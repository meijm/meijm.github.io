Itâ€™s my honor to be supported by more than 200 students and become an  student representative.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was disappointed by the series of formalism at the beginning of the Congress. This disappointment accumulated to a climax before the bureau election. I finally decided to interrupt the election and proposed to increase the candidate Q&amp;A  session.</p>

<p>For student Hanâ€™s loss, I felt very sorry. I have to admit that student Han is a very good speaker, but his content is too void. However, what ShanghaiTech really needs are doers, not speakers.</p>

<p>One more thing, On the way to the conference room, I met an excellent classmate, Who opened a series of courses on <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/76749099/channel/detail?cid=116957">Bilibili.com</a>. I wish this guy would got a position with an annual salary of 500,000 while still have time enjoy life.</p>

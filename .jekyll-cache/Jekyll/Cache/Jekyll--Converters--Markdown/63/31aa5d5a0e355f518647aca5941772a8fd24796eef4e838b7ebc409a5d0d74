<p>Big brother Ke Juntang left school today and is about to fly to <a href="(https://www.pcl.ac.cn/)">a laboratory in Shenzhen</a> to start his postdoctoral career. Although the group had already held farewell dinners a long time ago, when this day came, there were still a lot of disappointments in my heart.
When I first met the big brother, he was the assistant teacher of linear algebra of teacher Yuan Xiaojun. Although my roommate and I were assigned to other teaching assistant classes, we always came to take exercise classes with the big brother. The big brotherâ€™s explanation of the problem always hits the key point directly, and this will also be felt when listening to him in the group meeting in the future.
Later, I was fortunate to be in Teacher Liaoâ€™s group and learn more about the big brother. Big brotherâ€™s biggest hobby seems to be scientific research. When a student in the group mentions a certain problem or method, the big brother can always add the sentence â€œThis method/question/thesis, I have studied/read it beforeâ€. When several classmates in the previous group chatted about their graduation whereabouts, he said, â€œI actually think I can go anywhere. As long as I can provide a safe place to read the paper, even if the state assigns me to Xinjiang and Tibet, I am happy.â€
The second hobby might be to study Marxism-Leninism-Mao and other literary works. In addition to professional books and papers, there are â€œSelected Works of Mao Zedongâ€, â€œSelected Works of Deng Xiaopingâ€, â€œAnti-Duhring Theoryâ€, â€œU.S. Against Americaâ€, â€œCountry and â€œRevolutionâ€ and other books. I once heard Ma Yunâ€™s quotation â€œThere are many books in the office, and eight out of ten are liars.â€ I didnâ€™t understand what a â€œcommunist scholarâ€ was until I was crushed on the ground when I was sitting on the ground with my big brother.
The third hobby may be to spread red thoughts. Although the big brother is not a party member, he is still a party member than a party member. From time to time, I can receive â€œharassmentâ€ from senior brothers on WeChat, from the Yongzheng dynastyâ€™s â€œrectification of officialsâ€ to the Red Armyâ€™s Long March â€œscramble between north and southâ€, instilling red thoughts in all directions without dead ends. Finally, the big brother took me to basketball before graduation. â€œThe will of steel needs the support of steel.â€
The fourth hobby should be playing basketball. â€œUnresolved back jumperâ€ is the signature action of the big brother. On his personal homepage https://www.tangkejun.com/index.html, his profile picture is just a jump shot. There are some essays by big brothers on the website, and you are welcome to quote them.
Recently, the elder brother may have another hobby, taking the school girls in the group to go shopping and drink milk tea.
â€œYou can be an Iron Man if you can sit on a cold bench.â€ The big brother perfectly explained President Jiangâ€™s opening message. In terms of scientific research ability, the big brother always attributes this to the comfortable scientific research atmosphere created by Shanghai University of Science and Technology/Mr. In terms of red thinking, the big brother said that if you study more, you will not be deceived by crooked ways.</p>

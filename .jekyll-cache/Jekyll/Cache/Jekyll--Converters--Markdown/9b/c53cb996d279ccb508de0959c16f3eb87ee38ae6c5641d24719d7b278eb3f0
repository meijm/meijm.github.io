In fact, these things have been reported long ago. It also has been reported on Zhihu.com, Chinese version of Quora, <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/314238060">å¦‚ä½•çœ‹å¾…ä¸­å›½å†œå¦ä¹³ä¸šè”ç›ŸåŒè’™ç‰›ä¼Šåˆ©åˆ¶å¥¶æ ‡å‡†çš„å·®å¼‚ï¼Ÿ</a> last year.</p>

<p>ä¸­å›½å†œå¦ä¹³ä¸šè”ç›Ÿ Contains many high-quality domestic milk brands. I will not repeat it here. I paid much attention to milk safety issues as early as several years ago. Many people may think that domestic milk is not good, then why not buy imported milk. This is indeed a feasible method, but on JD.com and  Taobao.com platform, there is a lot of fake foreign milk (å‡æ´‹é¬¼å­å¥¶).</p>

<p>I compiled some reliable milk supplier brands last year, Now I share them with you, and welcome everyone to give me additional opinions.</p>

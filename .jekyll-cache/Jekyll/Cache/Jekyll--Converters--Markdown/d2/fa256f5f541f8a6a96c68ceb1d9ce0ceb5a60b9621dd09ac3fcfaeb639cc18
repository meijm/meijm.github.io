<p>Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
Which I by lacking have supposed dead;
And there reigns Love, and all Loveâ€™s loving partsï¼Œ
And all those friends which I thought buried.
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear religious love stolâ€™n from mine eye,
As interest of the dead, which now appear
But things removâ€™d that hidden in thee lie!
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
That due of many now is thine  alone:
    Their images I lovâ€™d I view in thee,
    And thouâ€”all theyâ€”hast all the all of me.</p>

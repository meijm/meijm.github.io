It’s my honor to be supported by more than 200 students and become an  student representative.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was disappointed by the series of formalism at the beginning of the Congress. This disappointment accumulated to a climax before the bureau election. I finally decided to interrupt the election and proposed to increase the candidate Q&amp;A  session.</p>

<p>For student Han’s loss, I felt very sorry. I have to admit that student Han is a very good speaker, but his content is too void. However, what ShanghaiTech really needs are doers, not speakers.</p>

排队时发生一个小插曲，有位同学A中暑晕倒在地，旁边几位同学围观着，有几位同学在打120电话。
我便立即跑入旁边食堂，抓了一大把纸巾蘸水后交给旁边同学，让他们替晕倒同学A擦拭额头及其四肢。
旁边一位围观同学自称本科有医学背景，希望前来协助，让我顿时有了自以为是救急中心主任的错觉。不过我三秒之内便清醒了，立马跑回了队伍继续排队。
几分钟后再次路过事发地时，校医正在路上。晕倒同学A已经清醒，现场还有同学在给A同学扇风，还有同学提供某某口服液。我寻思着，为啥没有人把A扶进50米处装有空调的食堂

A incident happened when queuing. A student A fainted on the ground due to heat stroke. Several students were watching and some were making 120 phone calls.I immediately ran into the nearby canteen, grabbed A large paper towel dipped in water and handed it to the students next to me. I asked them to wipe the forehead and limbs of A, who had fainted.One nearby classmate ,who claimed to have a medical background, wanted to provide assistance, which gave me the illusion that I was the director of the emergency center.But I woke up in three seconds and ran back to the queue.The school doctor was on his way when he passed the scene again a few minutes later.Classmate A has been awake in the faint. There are still some students fanning A , and some students provide some oral liquid.I wondered why no one had helped A into the air-conditioned canteen juest 50 metres away!

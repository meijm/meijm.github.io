Hello, this is Mei Jiaming. Currently studying at [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn) backed [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn), majoring in computer science and technology. I like swimming and badminton, recently also insist on running and body building. I was also lucky to learn a little bit Jiu-Jitsu under the guidance of [Ionut Grigorescu](https://www.facebook.com/ionut.grigorescu.9)

I am waiting for you at ShanghaiTech University, Please feel free to come and play with me.
